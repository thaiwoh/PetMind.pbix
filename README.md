This Project is about a Pet Store

#Introduction
PetMind is a U.S.-based pet retailer looking to optimize its product offerings and business strategy. 

### Some of the question i answered were 
1. **Top Revenue & Profit Categories:** Identifying the most profitable product categories for each pet type.
2. **.Repeat Purchases Impact:** Evaluating how frequently bought products contribute to revenue and profit.
3. **Product Size Influence:** Understanding how product sizes affect sales to gain insights into customer pet ownership trends.
4. **Top Revenue & Profit by Animals:**  Identifying the most profitable Animals.

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the Pet Store Data, i harnessed the power of several key tools
- **Excel:** Excel was used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and basic analysis. Functions like XLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, Pivot Tables, and conditional formatting helped in  organizing and summarizing key insights.
- **Power Query:** Power Query streamlined data transformation tasks such as data cleaning, merging, and shaping before loading into Power BI. It automated repetitive processes and 
    ensured data consistency.
- **Power BI:** Power BI was the primary tool for data visualization and analysis. It enabled the creation of interactive dashboard, and insightful reports to track performance and trends.
- **Git:** Git was used for version control, allowing me to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain different versions of the project without data loss.
- **GitHub:** GitHub served as the central repository for storing and sharing my project. It helped in collaboration, documentation, and maintaining a structured workflow for version 
   management.
